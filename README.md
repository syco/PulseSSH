# PulseSSH
PulseSSH is a fast and lightweight SSH and SFTP client built with Python and GTK4. It provides remote access, file transfer, and session management through a clean and efficient GUI. When graphical dependencies are unavailable, PulseSSH falls back to an ncurses interface offering limited functionality directly within the terminal.
